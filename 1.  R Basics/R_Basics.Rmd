## R Basics
Let's have a look at the RStudio IDE. You can choose the best appearance according to your own taste. You can do this in Tools > Global Options > Appearance. 

*Recommended:* Configure Git (after having downloaded it)

### The Console
You can run any code directly in the console. Just write it and press enter. Results are also shown in the console.

### The Workspace
Any values, functions, objects in general are loaded into the environment. Any object is added to the workspace and can be deleted with `rm()`. You can save and load workspaces.

### R Chunks
We'll have a more detailed explanation when we check R Markdown out. Nevertheless, I'll be using it to generate html files with text and the codes we generate in class.

```{r}
2+2
```

### Basic Operations
